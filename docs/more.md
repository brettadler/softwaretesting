# And more...

## CI/CD — Lean “Startup” Matrix

### Must-haves

- Linting (ESLint, Ruff/Flake8)
- Type checks (TypeScript, mypy)
- Unit & component tests
- API tests (smoke)
- Build
- Basic security (npm/yarn/pip audit)
- Formatting checks (Prettier/Black)
- Docker build

### Nice-to-have (Phase 2)

- Playwright/Cypress smoke on PR
- Contract tests
- Accessibility smoke (axe)
- Performance budget (Lighthouse)
- Migration checks
- DB schema drift
- Seeded test data

## Learning & Community

- **ISTQB levels:** Foundation → Advanced → Specialist → Expert; prep via books/courses and sample questions.
- **Events (US 2025–2026):** Major QA/testing conferences, including vendor events (e.g., Tricentis).
- **Reading:** Industry glossaries/definitions and curated book lists for foundation prep.

## Quick “Do Next” Checklist

1. Adopt the bug template and publish the reporting guide in Confluence.
2. Draft a 1-page Test Strategy (risk areas, environments, tooling, gates).
3. Stand up CI essentials (linters, types, unit tests, API smoke).
4. Pick UI automation (Playwright or Cypress) and add a single smoke flow.
5. Baseline accessibility (axe smoke) and email testing (Mailpit/Mailtrap) in dev.
6. Create a simple QA status dashboard (open defects by severity, test pass rate, release readiness).
7. Tune LinkedIn/resume with the targeted QA/SDET variant.
