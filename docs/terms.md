## Core Testing Types

- **Functional Testing:** Verifies that features work according to requirements, focusing on user actions and expected outcomes.
- **System Testing:** Validates the complete and integrated system for compliance with requirements.
- **Compatibility Testing:**  Cross-browser WebUI testing ensures consistent behavior and appearance across different browsers, devices, and operating systems.
- **Product Acceptance Testing:** Ensures the software meets business and end-user needs before release.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Confirms software is ready for deployment and meets business goals by having real users test it.
- **Regression Testing:** Re-tests existing functionality to ensure new code changes haven't introduced bugs in previously working features.
- **Smoke Testing:** A quick initial test to check if the most critical functions of the application work after a new build.
- **Sanity Testing:** Focused verification that specific functionality works after a bug fix or minor update.

## Approaches & Techniques

- **Black Box Testing:** Testing without knowledge of internal code.
- **White Box Testing:** Testing with full code-level knowledge.
- **Gray Box Testing:** Combines aspects of both black box and white box.
- **Exploratory Testing:** Unscripted, hands-on testing to uncover unexpected behavior, driven by tester intuition and experience.
- **Automation Testing:** Uses tools and scripts to speed up regression and repetitive tasks.
- **Subjective Testing:** Evaluates aspects like look-and-feel, design quality, or user preference, often based on human judgment.

## Specialized Testing Types

- **API Testing:** Verifies APIs return correct responses, handle errors gracefully, and integrate well with other systems.
- **Mobile App Testing:** Tests mobile apps across devices and operating systems for functionality, performance, and usability.
- **Web & UI Testing:** Ensures graphic uniformity and a consistent layout, styling, and branding across UI elements for a polished and professional look.
- **Performance Testing:** Assesses speed, responsiveness, and stability under load or stress.
- **Accessibility Testing:** Ensures usability by people with disabilities; validates compliance with standards like Section 508 and WCAG.
- **Usability Testing:** Observes real users to assess intuitiveness and ease of use.
- **Localization Testing:** Validates the software is adaptable for different languages, regions, and cultural expectations.
- **Location Testing:** Tests location-based features (e.g., GPS, geofencing) to ensure accurate behavior across regions and devices.
- **Livestream Testing:** Validates the quality and stability of live video streaming, including buffering, resolution, and latency.
- **Payments Testing:** Validates secure, accurate transactions across payment methods and currencies.
- **Voice Testing:** Tests voice-controlled interfaces (e.g., Alexa, Siri) for recognition and response.
- **AR/VR Testing:** Tests augmented and virtual reality applications for user experience, performance, and hardware compatibility.
- **Analytics Testing:** Ensures user actions are correctly tracked and reported in analytics platforms.
- **Real-Device Testing:** Runs apps or websites on actual physical devices to capture true performance.
