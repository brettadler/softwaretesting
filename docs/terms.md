## Core Testing Types

- **Functional Testing:** Verifies that features work according to requirements, focusing on user actions and expected outcomes.
- **System Testing:** Validates the complete and integrated system for compliance with requirements.
- **Acceptance Testing:** Ensures the software meets business and end-user needs before release.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Confirms software is ready for deployment and meets business goals.
- **Regression Testing:** Re-tests existing functionality to ensure new changes havenâ€™t broken anything.
- **Smoke Testing:** A quick initial check of core functionality after a new build.
- **Sanity Testing:** Focused verification that specific functionality works after a bug fix or minor update.

## Approaches & Techniques

- **Black Box Testing:** Testing without knowledge of internal code.
- **White Box Testing:** Testing with full code-level knowledge.
- **Gray Box Testing:** Combines aspects of both black box and white box.
- **Exploratory Testing:** Unscripted, hands-on testing guided by tester intuition.
- **Automation Testing:** Uses tools and scripts to speed up regression and repetitive tasks.
- **Subjective Testing:** Evaluates look, feel, and design quality based on human judgment.

## Specialized Testing Types

- **API Testing:** Verifies APIs return correct responses, handle errors gracefully, and integrate well with other systems.
- **Mobile App Testing:** Tests mobile apps across devices and OS versions for functionality and usability.
- **Web & UI Testing:** Includes **Graphic Uniformity Testing** (layout, styling, branding consistency).
- **Performance Testing:** Assesses speed, responsiveness, and stability under load or stress.
- **Accessibility Testing:** Ensures usability by people with disabilities; validates compliance with standards like Section 508 and WCAG.
- **Usability Testing:** Observes real users to assess intuitiveness and ease of use.
- **Compatibility Testing:** Ensures consistent behavior across browsers, devices, and OSes.
- **Localization Testing:** Validates language, cultural, and regional adaptations.
- **Location Testing:** Tests GPS, geofencing, and other location-based features.
- **Livestream Testing:** Checks video streaming quality (buffering, resolution, latency).
- **Payments Testing:** Validates secure, accurate transactions across payment methods and currencies.
- **Voice Testing:** Tests voice-controlled interfaces (e.g., Alexa, Siri) for recognition and response.
- **AR/VR Testing:** Validates augmented and virtual reality experiences, including performance and hardware compatibility.
- **Analytics Testing:** Ensures user actions are correctly tracked and reported in analytics platforms.
- **Real-Device Testing:** Runs apps or websites on actual physical devices to capture true performance.
