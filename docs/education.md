## Exam Prep for ISTQB Exam...
ISTQB Foundation Level – Complete Expanded Study Guide

### 7.1 Why the Glossary Matters
- The exam favors **precise, standard phrasing**; subtle term differences are common distractors.
- Learn ISTQB’s **exact definitions** (not local team jargon).

### 7.2 Core Term Distinctions
- **Error** (human mistake) → **Defect/Fault** (in code) → **Failure** (observed deviation at runtime).
- **Verification** (“building the product right”, static) vs. **Validation** (“building the right product”, dynamic).
- **Regression** (unchanged parts still work after change) vs. **Confirmation** (re-test the fix).
- **Functional** (what it does) vs. **Non-functional** (how well: performance, security, etc.).
- **Test Basis** (source docs), **Test Condition** (what to test), **Test Case** (inputs + expected), **Test Suite** (collection).
- **Coverage** (requirements, statements, decisions), **Defect density**, **Entry/Exit criteria**.
- **Roles in reviews**: moderator, author, reviewers, scribe.
- **Independent testing** levels and **test oracle** concept.

### 7.3 Exam Format
- **40 MCQs**, **60 minutes** (or **75** if eligible for extra time).
- **Passing**: **26/40 (65%)**.
- Questions: definition-based, scenario-based, term distinctions, process sequencing, technique application (EP/BVA/decision tables).

### 7.4 Prep Strategy (Actionable)
- **Daily**: 20 minutes of glossary flashcards (Anki/Quizlet); rotate by chapter.
- **Weekly**: full **mock exam**; track weak areas; review explanations.
- Build a **mind map** linking levels → types → techniques → tools.
- Practice **mini-calcs** for BVA/decision tables; rehearse **coverage** concepts.
- Join a **study group**; teach a topic (Feynman technique).

### 7.5 Tactics During the Exam
- Read stem and **underline qualifiers**: “**best**, **most likely**, **primary**, **first**”.
- Eliminate 2 wrong options; compare remaining by **exact glossary wording**.
- Manage time: ~90 seconds/question; mark and move; return later.
- Beware of **company terminology** vs. ISTQB terms.

### 7.6 High-Yield Term Shortlist
- Error / Defect / Failure
- Verification vs. Validation
- Regression vs. Confirmation testing
- Functional vs. Non-functional testing
- Test Basis / Condition / Case / Suite
- Entry & Exit criteria
- Incident (defect) report
- Test oracle; Independence levels
- Coverage (statement, decision, requirements)

### Final Tips
- Anchor your answers to **ISTQB definitions** and the **testing principles**.
- Prioritize **risk-based** thinking and **traceability** across requirements → tests → defects.
- Keep a **lightweight regression suite** + **checklists** for exploratory sessions.
- Remember: **tools amplify good processes**—they don’t replace them.
