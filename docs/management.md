# Test Management

### Organization & Independence
- Options: developers test, embedded testers, independent team, external org.
- Higher independence → objectivity; lower → deeper product knowledge.

### Planning & Estimation
- Inputs: risk, scope, complexity, history, skills, environments, constraints.
- Estimation: **expert judgment**, **metrics-based** (historical velocity, defect arrival curves).

### Monitoring & Control
- **Metrics**: executed/blocked/passed/failed %, defect status/age/density/leakage, coverage progress, burn-up/down.
- **Reporting**: clear visuals, risks, trends, recommendations.

### Configuration Management (CM)
- Identify and control **versions** of code, data, environments, testware.
- Ensure **traceability** and **repeatability**.

### Risk-Based Testing
- **Product risk** (quality attributes, critical features) vs. **Project risk** (schedule, people, tools).
- Prioritize **test depth & breadth** where risk and impact are highest.

### Defect Management
- Lifecycle: **new → assigned → open → fixed → re-tested → closed** (or rejected/duplicate/deferred).
- Report content: ID, title, summary, steps to reproduce, expected/actual, **severity vs. priority**, environment, attachments, links.
