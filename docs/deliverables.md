# Deliverables in Software Testing

## Documentation Process

Clear documentation makes teamwork smoother and ensures quality at every stage. Key artifacts include:

- **Test Strategy:** Big-picture plan for a company or product, including approaches, tooling, environments, release criteria, and more.
- **Test Plan:** Release/feature specific test plans, including what to test, how to test, release criteria, resources, and more.
- **Test Cases & Charters:** Step-by-step scripts or focused exploratory missions.
- **Traceability Matrix:** Maps requirements to tests (e.g., Req ID, Test IDs, Status, Risks).


Essential terms:
- **Test Condition:** What you verify (rule, requirement, path).
- **Test Case:** Steps, data, expected result.
- **Test Data:** Values you use (normal, boundary, negative).
- **Test Suite:** Bundle of related cases.
- **Test Environment:** Sandboxâ€”tools, servers, configs, data.
- **Testware:** All testing artifacts (plans, cases, scripts, reports).
- **Entry / Exit Criteria:** When to start/stop (e.g., Entry: env ready, data loaded; Exit: 0 criticals, 95% high-priority tests passed).
